# Standards Base Grading Portal

This is a personal project to replace existing gradebooks for professors and teachers where built-in options don't have required functionality. The overall goal of the project is to provide a viable alternative to professors to using fragile Excel spreadsheets to track student grades and provide more functionality and flexibility for reporting on granular student outcomes.
